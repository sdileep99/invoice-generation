# invoice-generation
Invoices display a list of purchased items and services alongside the total amount a customer must pay.
 The invoice record itself contains important details such as the balance, due date, and payment status.
 Using an invoice generator not only saves on time, but also saves on the costs of paper, stamps, and/or envelopes. Even more so, having a paperless method for invoicing eliminates the need for filing and storage (after all, most invoices, receipts, and business tax financials have to maintain for 7 years).
